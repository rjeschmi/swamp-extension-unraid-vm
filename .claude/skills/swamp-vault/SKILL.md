# Swamp Vault Skill

Manage secure secret storage through swamp vaults. All commands support `--json`
for machine-readable output.

## Quick Reference

| Task              | Command                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| List vault types  | `swamp vault type search --json`           |
| Create a vault    | `swamp vault create <type> <name> --json`  |
| Search vaults     | `swamp vault search [query] --json`        |
| Get vault details | `swamp vault get <name_or_id> --json`      |
| Edit vault config | `swamp vault edit <name_or_id>`            |
| Store a secret    | `swamp vault put <vault> KEY=VALUE --json` |
| Get a secret      | `swamp vault get <vault> <key> --json`     |
| List secret keys  | `swamp vault list-keys <vault> --json`     |

## Repository Structure

Vaults use the dual-layer architecture:

- **Data directory (`/.swamp/vault/`)** - Internal storage by vault type
- **Logical views (`/vaults/`)** - Human-friendly symlinked directories

```
/vaults/{vault-name}/
  vault.yaml → ../.swamp/vault/{type}/{id}.yaml
  secrets/ → ../.swamp/secrets/{type}/{vault-name}/ (local_encryption only)
```

## Vault Types

Two vault types are available:

### local_encryption

Stores secrets encrypted locally using AES-GCM. Best for development and local
workflows.

```yaml
config:
  auto_generate: true # Generate encryption key automatically
  # OR
  ssh_key_path: "~/.ssh/id_rsa" # Use SSH key for encryption
```

### aws

Integrates with AWS Secrets Manager. Best for production environments.

```yaml
config:
  region: "us-east-1" # Required
  # profile: "default"  # Optional: AWS profile name
```

## Create a Vault

```bash
swamp vault create local_encryption dev-secrets --json
swamp vault create aws prod-secrets --json
```

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "id": "abc-123",
  "name": "dev-secrets",
  "type": "local_encryption",
  "path": ".swamp/vault/local_encryption/abc-123.yaml"
}
```

After creation, edit the config if needed:

```bash
swamp vault edit dev-secrets
```

## Store Secrets

```bash
swamp vault put dev-secrets API_KEY=sk-1234567890 --json
swamp vault put prod-secrets DB_PASSWORD=secret123 -f --json  # Skip confirmation
```

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "vault": "dev-secrets",
  "key": "API_KEY",
  "status": "stored"
}
```

## Get a Secret

Retrieve a specific secret value from a vault.

```bash
swamp vault get dev-secrets API_KEY --json
```

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "vault": "dev-secrets",
  "key": "API_KEY",
  "value": "sk-1234567890"
}
```

**Note:** Use with caution. Secret values are sensitive and should not be logged
or displayed unnecessarily.

## List Secret Keys

Returns key names only (never values):

```bash
swamp vault list-keys dev-secrets --json
```

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "vault": "dev-secrets",
  "keys": ["API_KEY", "DB_PASSWORD"]
}
```

## Vault Expressions

Access secrets in model inputs and workflows using CEL expressions:

```yaml
attributes:
  apiKey: ${{ vault.get(dev-secrets, API_KEY) }}
  dbPassword: ${{ vault.get(prod-secrets, DB_PASSWORD) }}
```

**Key rules:**

- Vault must exist before expression evaluation
- Expressions are evaluated lazily at runtime
- Failed lookups throw errors with helpful messages

## Using Vaults in Workflows

For detailed workflow integration including the `swamp/lets-get-sensitive`
model, see the **swamp-workflow** skill.

**Quick syntax reference:**

```yaml
# In workflow step attributes
apiKey: ${{ vault.get(vault-name, secret-key) }}

# Environment-specific
prodToken: ${{ vault.get(prod-secrets, auth-token) }}
devToken: ${{ vault.get(dev-secrets, auth-token) }}
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Environment separation**: Use different vaults for dev/staging/prod
2. **Never hardcode**: Always use vault expressions for secrets
3. **Audit access**: Monitor vault operations through logs
4. **Key rotation**: Rotate secrets and encryption keys regularly

## When to Use Other Skills

| Need                     | Use Skill        |

| Vault usage in workflows | `swamp-workflow` |
| Create/run models        | `swamp-model`    |
| Repository structure     | `swamp-repo`     |
| Manage model data        | `swamp-data`     |
