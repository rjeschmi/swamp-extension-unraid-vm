# Project

This repository is managed with [swamp](https://github.com/systeminit/swamp).

## Rules

1. **Extension models for service integrations.** When automating AWS, APIs, or any external service, ALWAYS create an extension model in `extensions/models/`. Use the `swamp-extension-model` skill for guidance. The `command/shell` model is ONLY for ad-hoc one-off shell commands, NEVER for wrapping CLI tools or building integrations.
2. **Extend, don't be clever.** Don't work around a missing capability with shell scripts or multi-step hacks. Add a method to the extension model. One method, one purpose.
3. **Use the data model.** Once data exists in a model (via `lookup`, `start`, `sync`, etc.), reference it with CEL expressions. Don't re-fetch data that's already available.
4. **CEL expressions everywhere.** Wire models together with `model.*` expressions. Always prefer `model.<name>.resource.<spec>.<instance>.attributes.<field>` over `data.latest()`.
5. **Verify before destructive operations.** Always `swamp model get <name> --json` and verify resource IDs before running delete/stop/destroy methods.
